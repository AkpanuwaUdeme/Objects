The answers to Question 1,2,3, 4 and 5 are in the index.js file

Question 4: what are the different ways we can clone an object with examples(i will write the examples in the index.js)

Answers:

1.Object.assign(): The Object.assign() method creates a new object by copying the properties of one or more source objects to a target object. This method creates a shallow copy of the object, meaning that nested objects and arrays are still referenced by the new object. 

2.Spread operator: The spread operator is another way to perform a shallow copy of an object. It spreads the properties of an object into a new object.

3.JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods: The JSON.parse() method converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object, while JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string. By using these methods, we can create a deep copy of an object.
